# House Prices Predictions
House prices predictions with advanced regression techniques is a competition I've participated on Kaggle recently.
Here you can see the details: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

Basically, the dataset is performed by 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The main goal of the competition is to predict the final price of each home.

It's a nice challenge for those who are making their firsts steps into feature engineering and advanced regression techniques.
